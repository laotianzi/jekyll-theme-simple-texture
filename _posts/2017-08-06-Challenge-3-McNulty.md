# Project 3 McNulty Project --- Climate Change and Human Activities

## Story
Global warming is happening according to monthly global temperature data from Kaggle. To modeling climate change is a complicated problem. It's related to the sun, the sea, the current, and the human activities, etc. This project will only focus on several reasons that caused by human activities to the climate.

Well, how does it related to the countries?

Which country's temperature is changing a lot?

### PostScript
The motivation of this story was very personal. My adviser who is a distinguished professor in Physics, teaches strictly and the lectures are high quality. He likes the students who fully dedicate to the course. But many students choose physics course only for science credits, they want easy lecture easy finals no quizs and no gain in physics. That's why my professor got lower and lower rating when he maintains his teaching quality.
